 CGPA Calculator (C++)
This project is a CGPA Calculator developed in C++ as part of the CodeAlpha Tasks.
The program calculates a student’s GPA and overall CGPA based on the number of courses, their respective grades, and credit hours.
It takes user input for each course, computes total credit hours and total grade points (grade × credit hours), and then accurately calculates the final CGPA. The project demonstrates the use of core C++ concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and basic input/output operations.
